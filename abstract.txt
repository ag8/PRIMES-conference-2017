The advent of next-generation sequencing technologies provides access to genomic and
epigenetic data, such as sequence motifs, histone modifications, as well as structural motifs and
binding factors. It has been shown that most of these profiles contribute significantly to gene
enrichment and expression. In our study, we propose using deep convolutional neural networks
for the purpose of analyzing the functional importance of genomic structures, such as protein
enrichment based on Hi-C data. We discuss several methods of representing and convolving over
the genomeâ€™s 3-D shape, as well as using techniques such as one-shot learning in order to
determine the spatial orientation of bound factors. Further, we suggest a cross-species
comparison of structural motifs in an attempt to pinpoint the evolutionary significance of the
enrichment of specific genes.
